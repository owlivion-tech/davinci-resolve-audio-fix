Description: Fix AAC audio in DaVinci Resolve on Linux
 DaVinci Resolve on Linux does not support AAC audio — the codec used
 by most cameras, phones, and downloaded videos. This tool automatically
 detects and converts AAC audio to PCM, making files fully compatible
 with DaVinci Resolve while preserving video quality without re-encoding.
 .
 Features: directory watcher (systemd), Nautilus right-click integration,
 DaVinci Resolve script (Workspace -> Scripts), and manual batch conversion.
